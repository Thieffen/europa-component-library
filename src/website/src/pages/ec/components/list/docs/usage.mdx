<Paragraph size="lead">
  Used to present chunks of information in a concise and scannable way, lists
  help to organize content related to a single topic, grouping together a set of
  items or text options.
</Paragraph>

## Anatomy

A list is a series of related items displayed in a single column. The content of each item can be plain text, an external link or a short paragraph. Even if lists can be nested inside of each other (to display sub-sections for example), it's not recommended nesting lists deeper than three levels in order to avoid confusion.

Below we'll cover the three list types: [ordered](#ordered), [unordered](#unordered), [description list](#description-list).

<h2 id="ordered">Ordered list</h2>

Ordered lists display a set of items in a specific and logical order.
They are commonly used in step by step instructions.

Please note that different list styles can be applied to list items, like numbers, roman numerals or letters.

<DoDont
  itemDo={{
    title: 'Do',
    image:
      'https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/List/ordered-list-desktop-do.jpg',
    alt: '',
    description: 'Show items in the right logical order.',
  }}
  itemDont={{
    title: "Don't",
    image:
      'https://inno-ecl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/EC/List/ordered-list-desktop-dont.jpg',
    alt: '',
    description:
      'Respect the sequential order and do not use unordered or blank lists.',
  }}
/>

<h2 id="unordered">Unordered list</h2>

Unordered lists are used to show content with the same importance, so the order of the items doesn't matter.

Please note that different list styles can be applied to bullets, like disc, circle, square or hyphen.

### Guidelines

- be sure to organize the items in a logical way
- start bullet list items with a lowercase letter and blank list items with capital letters
- limit the numbers of items between 5 to 9

<h2 id="description-list">Description list</h2>

### Vertical description list

Description lists are lists of terms with their related definition or description, like a glossary or a list of speakers with relative biography.

#### Guidelines

- avoid using more than one or two short sentences
- add a meaningful description or explanation of each term, avoiding active voices

#### When to use

- use a bullet list when the order of the items is not relevant and to increase scannability and readability
- use an ordered list when you need to communicate priorities or to show a specific sequence
- use a description list when the terms in the list require a specific description or explanation

#### When not to use

- do not use for navigation purpose; use <Link to="/ec/compositions/navigation-lists/usage/">navigation lists</Link> instead
- do not use to display search results; use <Link to="/ec/utilities/stacks/usage/">stacks</Link> instead

### Horizontal description list

#### Introduction

Horizontal description list **displays information or related links**, based on the context presented in the page.

**Default**

| Elements | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| heading  | yes       | heading for the category, explains the **relation** of the text or link items (e.g. Last updated)                                                                                        |
| text     | yes       | contextual information with regards to the Heading<br /><br />**Note**: input is done through a rich-text editor, we recommend stylisation and addition of further elements to a minimum |
| link(s)  | no        | URL links to **related content**, done through the rich-text editor as well<br /><br />**Note**: if multiple links are added, they will be separated by a divider                        |
| tag(s)   | no        | complementary tags, associated to the page's content                                                                                                                                     |

#### Do's

- **label each item** with a short, distinct and indicative title
- choose the **appropriate category in terms of relevance** and added value to the users
- **group** related fields according to their type
- **order** logically according to their hierarchy, significance and degree of relatedness

#### Don'ts

- don't implement the horizontal description list navigation arbitrarily - there has to be a specific reason for its usage that cannot be covered otherwise

#### When to use

- **on content pages to add additional information** (such as lastest update on the content of a page) **or link to pages of interest**
- **on class navigation pages to indicate overarching category or theme items are part of** (such as department in charge of content)

#### When not to use

- **do not use for as main navigation**

#### Notes
- horizontal description list can only be placed in 2 locations:
  - **at the top of the page**, below the title, aiding users with information that is relevant to the page or context
  - **near the bottom of the page** to serve as a next step to further related content or links
